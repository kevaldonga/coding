notes for files I/O
    note ->
        -->   ifstream is to read any lines in a files and store it in a string
                -->you can use two methods to do it 
                    1.using its default method
                        objectname>> string;  
                        -->   default reading function using operands >> can only print one word after it will be terminated.
                    2.using getline function 
                        getline(objname,string);
                        -->   getline also has its downsides it will only print one line and as new line is shown it will be terminated.
        -->   ofstream is to write any lines in a file
                -->there is simply only one easy method
                    objectname<<"content you want to print ";
        -->there are two ways to open files in files I/O 
                    1.using its constructor
                        classname(*ifstream or ofstream) objname("filesname.txt);
                    2. create an object and then open it by void open function
                        ofstream |or| ifstream objname;
                        open.objname("filesname.txt");
        -->   you can't write in a file and read in a file at same time
        -->   you can close the files by only one function which is void close
                -->objname.close();
